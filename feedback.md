# Implementing the $1 Gesture Recognizer

- wrong path to dataset **(-0.5)**
- UI: no line between dots **(-0.5)**
- not reliable (triangles, rects, circle) **(-1)**
- why did u use tkinter? (just interested)

# Comparing Gesture Recognizers

- systematic comparison: good!
- you left out the $1 recognizer from the comparison **(-1)**
- notebook cell with accuracy evaluation makes no sense **(-0.5)**

```
   all_accuracies.append(np.mean(prediction == y_test))
   print('Accuracy:', np.mean(prediction == y_test))
```

- never ever ever ever ever make 3D plots :o

# Gesture Detection Game

- aesthetic: niice!
- gameplay: niice!
- would be very nice but gesture recognition does not work **(-2)**

**Overall: 9.5**
